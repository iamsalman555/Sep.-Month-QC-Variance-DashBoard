# September-Month-QC-Variance-DashBoard
This project involved creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and monitor Quality Control (QC) variance for September. The focus was on comparing QC capacity with delivered products, identifying backlogs, and evaluating performance metrics across various dimensions such as customers, processes, and managers. Data was cleaned, modeled, and connected across tables for accurate insights.

Key features included interactive visualizations like stacked bar charts, pie charts, decomposition trees, and date-wise trends, alongside buttons for page navigation and slicer control. Advanced DAX queries were used to calculate delivery targets, while variance analysis highlighted gaps between planned QC capacity and actual performance. The dashboard provided actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and manage backlogs effectively.
This project demonstrates expertise in data modeling, visualization, and interactive dashboard design in Power BI.
